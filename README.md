# ‚úÖ React Todo App ‚Äì Context API Project

This is my sixth React project A beginner-friendly **Todo App** built in **React.js**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**, with a focus on learning the **React Context API** by managing a shared todo state.

## üß† Main Goal

This wasn‚Äôt just another Todo app.

> The goal was to **master React Context API** in a real-world component-based setup.

I had used it in a theme toggler before, but this project helped me:
- Manage global state (todos) with Context
- Share logic (add, update, delete, toggle) cleanly across components
- Avoid prop drilling
